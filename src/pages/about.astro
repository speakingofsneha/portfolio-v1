              I'm a penultimate year Interaction Design & Psychological Science student based in Sydney (but madras has my 🤍). <br><br>
              The best part about being 20 is undergoing a character metamorphosis every month. 
              The worst part however, is how hard it is to write a bio because I’m constantly changing, 
              but I think I know who I am... an artist, designer, writer, developer and a very cool 
              person trust me on this!!! I’ve worn many hats but to me, the label isn’t what matters. <br><br>
              Pixels, “words”, &lt;code&gt; and their interactions are mediums through which we stumble across
              new perspectives, Essentially, if I had to explain myself and the work I do to a 10, 30 and 70 year old collectively, 
              I draw from life and try to make things that change our stories for the better 🫂
