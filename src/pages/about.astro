                Hello, I'm Sneha! I’m currently pursuing a BDes/Adv in Interaction Design and Psychological Science at the University of Sydney. 
                I am an artist, designer, writer, developer and a very cool person trust me on this ;)
                I’ve worn many hats but to me, the label isn’t what matters. <br><br>
                Pixels, “words”, &lt;code&gt; and their interactions are mediums through which we stumble across
                new perspectives and if I had to explain myself and the work I do to a 10, 30 and 70 year old collectively -
                I draw from life and try to make things that change our lives for the better  🫂  <br><br>
