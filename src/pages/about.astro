                I’m Sneha, an interaction design and psychological science student based in Sydney (but madras 
                has my heart) <br><br>
                The best part about being 20 is undergoing a character metamorphosis every month. The worst part 
                however, is how hard it is to write a bio because I’m constantly changing, but I think I know who I am... 
                an artist, designer, writer, developer and a very cool person trust me on this!!! I’ve worn many hats but to me, 
                the label isn’t what matters.<br><br>
                Pixels, “words”, &lt;code&gt; and their interactions are mediums through which we stumble across
                new perspectives and if I had to explain myself and the work I do to a 10, 30 and 70 year old collectively -
                I draw from life and try to make things that change our stories for the better  🫂
