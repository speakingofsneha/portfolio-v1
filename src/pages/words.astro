        Welcome to the home of my thoughts. Everywhere else I prefer to let my creative voice take precedence over my opinion, 
        but here you can find the ways I see the world, pursue craft, and approach life.
        <br><br>
        I have no interest in defining what makes a good designer or dishing advice on how to achieve maximum hustle. 
        I don’t care if I’m a generalist or a specialist or if designers should learn to code or if engineers should learn to design. 
        <br><br>
        Everyone has different ideals, goals, ambitions for their craft and I respect them all. Who am I to judge what somebody else cares about? 
        <br><br>
        Me: I care about living with joy- stare at the sky, rot in bed, blast good music, laugh with friends, eat good food, 
        fall in love, laugh at yourself, listen to people you don’t agree with, learn to grow and create the things that you want to.
        <br><br>
        Don’t fear wasting time, fear not enjoying your time. Achievement is wonderful, but in chasing it ask yourself are you happy?
        <br><br>
        Believe that life is good, people are beautiful and it (they) will be.
